## Design Decisions

### 1. Determining Distinct Color Names

**Challenge**: The requirement is to render "a single swatch for each of the distinct hue names" for given S and L values. With 360 possible hue values, how do we efficiently determine which colors have unique names?

**Solution**:
- **Fetch All Hues**: Always fetch all 360 hues (0-359°) for the given S/L combination
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Filter the results to show only colors with distinct names
- **Skip Unnamed Colors**: Exclude colors where the API returns no name or "Unnamed"
- **Track Seen Names**: Use a Set to track color names we've already displayed

This ensures we always show the complete set of distinct named colors for any S/L combination.

### 2. API Call Optimization Strategy

**Challenge**: Fetching 360 hues per S/L combination could result in excessive API calls and slow performance.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-layered optimization strategy:
- **The Color API**: Uses https://www.thecolorapi.com/ which provides proper CORS headers
- **Aggressive Caching**: All 360 API responses are cached in-memory with a Map keyed by `hue,saturation,lightness`
- **Batch Processing**: API calls are processed in batches of 10 concurrent requests to balance speed and server load
- **Debouncing**: User input is debounced by 500ms to prevent API calls during active slider adjustment
- **Smart Loading States**: Only show loading indicator when fetching uncached data
- **Data Validation**: Validates API responses to ensure data structure integrity before rendering

**Performance Result**: After the initial 360 API calls for S=50/L=50, adjusting sliders to cached S/L values is instant (0 API calls). This means exploring different S/L combinations is very fast after the first load.

**API Format**: The Color API accepts HSL queries in the format `/id?hsl=h,s,l` and returns comprehensive color data including RGB values, hex codes, and color names from a database of 2000+ named colors.

### 3. User Experience for Input Controls

**Decision**: Dual-input controls (slider + number input) with debouncing

**Rationale**:
- **Sliders** provide intuitive visual adjustment and are familiar to users
- **Number inputs** allow precise value entry for specific requirements
- **Real-time updates** show immediate visual feedback while typing/sliding
- **Debounced API calls** prevent excessive requests during adjustment without sacrificing perceived responsiveness
- The UI updates instantly with the current values, while API calls wait for the user to pause

This creates a responsive feel while being efficient with network resources.

### 4. Rendering Strategy

**Decision**: Virtual scrolling with react-window instead of rendering all swatches at once

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: The number of distinct color names varies (typically 30-150 depending on S/L), but DOM rendering can still be expensive
- **Memory efficiency**: Only visible swatches (and a small buffer) exist in the DOM
- **Scalability**: The approach handles any number of distinct colors efficiently
- **Smooth scrolling**: Hardware-accelerated scrolling remains smooth even on lower-end devices
- **Future-proof**: If The Color API adds more named colors, the app will still perform well

The trade-off is slightly more complex code, but the performance benefits are substantial, especially on mobile devices.

### 5. Responsive Grid Layout

**Decision**: CSS Grid with viewport-based column counts and full-width utilization

**Breakpoints**:
- Mobile (<640px): 2 columns
- Tablet (640-1024px): 3 columns
- Small Desktop (1024-1280px): 4 columns
- Medium Desktop (1280-1536px): 5 columns
- Large Desktop (>1536px): 6 columns

**Rationale**:
- Maximizes screen real estate usage at all viewport sizes
- Maintains readable swatch sizes (not too small on mobile, not too large on desktop)
- Works seamlessly with virtualization
- No wasted space or awkward gaps

### Key Technologies

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Aggressive Caching**: All 360 hue values are cached per S/L combination for instant subsequent access
2. **Smart Loading States**: Only shows loading indicator when fetching uncached data (not when using cached colors)
3. **Batch API Requests**: Processes 360 API calls in batches of 10 concurrent requests
4. **Debounced Input**: 500ms debounce reduces API calls from hundreds to one per user pause
5. **Virtualization**: Only renders visible swatches in the viewport (~20-30 at a time)
6. **React.memo**: Components are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
7. **useCallback**: Event handlers are memoized to maintain referential equality
8. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error recovery without full app crashes
9. **Null Safety**: Comprehensive null/undefined checks prevent runtime errors

**Real-World Performance**: Initial load with S=50, L=50 makes 360 API calls (takes ~3-5 seconds with batching). After that, changing to S=100, L=50 is instant if already cached, or takes another ~3-5 seconds if not cached. Exploring previously-visited S/L combinations is always instant.

## Answering the Assessment Questions

### How efficiently can the distinct names be determined?

The application fetches all 360 hues upfront and filters client-side for distinct names. While this requires 360 API calls initially, the aggressive caching strategy means:
- First S/L combination: ~3-5 seconds (360 API calls in batches)
- Subsequent visits to same S/L: Instant (0 API calls)
- The filtering for distinct names happens in O(n) time client-side using a Set

### Can the number of API calls be reduced?

Yes, significantly:
- **Caching**: After initial load, revisiting S/L combinations requires 0 API calls
- **Debouncing**: Prevents API calls while user is actively adjusting sliders
- **Batch Processing**: Parallelizes requests without overwhelming the server
- **Smart Loading States**: Only shows loading when actually fetching from API

### Do all colors need to be rendered at once?

No. Virtualization with react-window ensures only visible swatches are in the DOM:
- Only ~20-30 swatches rendered at any given time
- Smooth scrolling with hardware acceleration
- Minimal memory footprint

### When will the API calls be made?

- **On mount**: Fetches all 360 hues for default S=50, L=50
- **On S/L change**: Fetches all 360 hues for new S/L combination (after 500ms debounce)
- **Cached access**: No API calls when revisiting previously-fetched S/L combinations

### What is the best user experience for selecting S and L values?

Dual-input controls (slider + number input) provide flexibility:
- **Sliders**: Intuitive, visual exploration of color space
- **Number inputs**: Precise value entry for specific requirements
- **Real-time feedback**: Values update instantly, API calls are debounced
- **Visual feedback**: Current S/L values displayed prominently

### What sort of feedback will the user receive?

- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens show while fetching data
- **Loading indicator**: Spinner with "Loading colors..." message
- **Error messages**: User-friendly, actionable error messages with dismiss button
- **Smooth transitions**: No jarring UI changes when switching between cached S/L values
- **Color count**: User can see how many distinct colors exist for each S/L combination

## Future Enhancements

- **Export functionality**: Save color palettes as JSON, CSS, or images
- **Favorites/History**: Bookmark interesting color combinations
- **Complementary colors**: Show complementary/analogous color schemes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG contrast ratios and keyboard navigation
- **URL state**: Shareable links with specific S/L values
- **Preload common combinations**: Cache popular S/L values in the background
